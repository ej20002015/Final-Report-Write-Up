\section{Identifying the evaluation scenes}

[Intro]

\subsubsection{Fresnel Effect}

[This is the key point: in the real world the relative proportions of matte and specular appearance change with viewing
angle. - Practitioners guide to reflectance models]

\subsubsection{Long Tailed Specular Highlights}

\subsubsection{HDR? Energy Conservation?}

<Results, evaluation (including user evaluation) {\em etc.} should be described in one or more chapters. See the `Results and Discussion' criterion in the mark scheme for the sorts of material that may be included here.>

Fresnel effect shown; energy conservation shown; more artist options shown; show the specular lobe is more accurate using PBR approaches (page 338 of the real-time rendering book)? Take pictures from papers - reconstruct scene and show how PBR is close to the paper image and Blinn-Phong isn't.
