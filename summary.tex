\noindent Physically based shading models have seen widespread adoption within the real-time rendering industry. This paper explores their use, and investigates why they have superseded the previous standard, the Blinn-Phong shading model. The theory underpinning physically based shading models is explored in depth, from physical principles, all the way up to specific mathematical implementations. A software application is developed that renders scenes using either the Blinn-Phong shading model, or a specific physically based shading model. This program is utilised to perform a comparison between the two models; the results of which show that there are physical phenomena that physically based shading models represent more accurately than the Blinn-Phong shading model. Thus, it is exhibited that physically based shading models render frames that are more photorealistic than those obtained using the Blinn-Phong shading model.
