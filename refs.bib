	abstract = {The quality of computer generated images of three-dimensional scenes depends on the shading technique used to paint the objects on the cathode-ray tube screen. The shading algorithm itself depends in part on the method for modeling the object, which also determines the hidden surface algorithm. The various methods of object modeling, shading, and hidden surface removal are thus strongly interconnected. Several shading techniques corresponding to different methods of object modeling and the related hidden surface algorithms are presented here. Human visual perception and the fundamental laws of optics are considered in the development of a shading rule that provides better quality and increased realism in generated images.},

	abstract = {In the production of computer generated pictures of three dimensional objects, one stage of the calculation is the determination of the intensity of a given object once its visibility has been established. This is typically done by modelling the surface as a perfect diffuser, sometimes with a specular component added for the simulation of hilights. This paper presents a more accurate function for the generation of hilights which is based on some experimental measurements of how light reflects from real surfaces. It differs from previous models in that the intensity of the hilight changes with the direction of the light source. Also the position and shape of the hilights is somewhat different from that generated by simpler models. Finally, the hilight function generates different results when simulating metallic vs. nonmetallic surfaces. Many of the effects so generated are somewhat subtle and are apparent only during movie sequences. Some representative still frames from such movies are included.},

	abstract = {We present a reflection model for isotropic rough surfaces thathave both specular and diffuse components. The surface is assumedto have a normal distribution of heights. Parameters of the modelare the surface roughness given by the rms slope, the albedo, and thebalance between diffuse and specular reflection. The effect ofroughness on diffuse reflection is taken into account, instead of ourmodeling this component as a constant Lambertian term. The modelincludes geometrical effects such as masking and shadowing. Themodel is compared with experimental data obtained from goniophotometricmeasurements on samples of tiles and bricks. The model fits well tosamples with very different reflection properties. Measurements ofthe sample profiles performed with a laser profilometer to determinethe rms slope show that the assumed surface model is realistic. Themodel could therefore be used in machine vision and computer graphicsto approximate reflection characteristics of surfaces. It couldalso be used to predict the texture of surfaces as a function ofillumination and viewing angles.},
