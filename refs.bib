The shading algorithm itself depends in part on the method for modeling the object, which also determines the hidden surface algorithm. The various methods of object modeling, shading, and hidden surface removal are thus strongly interconnected. Several shading techniques corresponding to different methods of object modeling and the related hidden surface algorithms are presented here. Human visual perception and the fundamental laws of optics are considered in the development of a shading rule that provides better quality and increased realism in generated images.},

This is typically done by modelling the surface as a perfect diffuser, sometimes with a specular component added for the simulation of hilights. This paper presents a more accurate function for the generation of hilights which is based on some experimental measurements of how light reflects from real surfaces. It differs from previous models in that the intensity of the hilight changes with the direction of the light source. Also the position and shape of the hilights is somewhat different from that generated by simpler models. Finally, the hilight function generates different results when simulating metallic vs. nonmetallic surfaces. Many of the effects so generated are somewhat subtle and are apparent only during movie sequences. Some representative still frames from such movies are included.},

Parameters of the modelare the surface roughness given by the rms slope, the albedo, and thebalance between diffuse and specular reflection. The effect ofroughness on diffuse reflection is taken into account, instead of ourmodeling this component as a constant Lambertian term. The modelincludes geometrical effects such as masking and shadowing. Themodel is compared with experimental data obtained from goniophotometricmeasurements on samples of tiles and bricks. The model fits well tosamples with very different reflection properties. Measurements ofthe sample profiles performed with a laser profilometer to determinethe rms slope show that the assumed surface model is realistic. Themodel could therefore be used in machine vision and computer graphicsto approximate reflection characteristics of surfaces. It couldalso be used to predict the texture of surfaces as a function ofillumination and viewing angles.},

The model enables efficient simulation of effects that BRDF models cannot capture, such as color bleeding within materials and diffusion of light across shadow boundaries. The technique is efficient even for anisotropic, highly scattering media that are expensive to simulate using existing methods. The model combines an exact solution for single scattering with a dipole point source diffusion approximation for multiple scattering. We also have designed a new, rapid image-based measurement technique for determining the optical properties of translucent materials. We validate the model by comparing predicted and measured values and show how the technique can be used to recover the optical properties of a variety of materials, including milk, marble, and skin. Finally, we describe sampling techniques that allow the model to be used within a conventional ray tracer.},

The model has been especially intended for computer graphics applications and therefore includes two main features: simplicity (a small number of intuitively understandable parameters controls the model) and efficiency (the formulation provides adequation to Monte-Carlo rendering techniques and/or hardware implementations).},

	abstract = {Modeling multiple scattering in microfacet theory is considered an important open problem because a non-negligible portion of the energy leaving rough surfaces is due to paths that bounce multiple times. In this paper we derive the missing multiple-scattering components of the popular family of BSDFs based on the Smith microsurface model. Our derivations are based solely on the original assumptions of the Smith model. We validate our BSDFs using raytracing simulations of explicit random Beckmann surfaces.Our main insight is that the microfacet theory for surfaces with the Smith model can be derived as a special case of the microflake theory for volumes, with additional constraints to enforce the presence of a sharp interface, i.e. to transform the volume into a surface. We derive new free-path distributions and phase functions such that plane-parallel scattering from a microvolume with these distributions exactly produces the BSDF based on the Smith microsurface model, but with the addition of higher-order scattering.With this new formulation, we derive multiple-scattering micro-facet BSDFs made of either diffuse, conductive, or dielectric material. Our resulting BSDFs are reciprocal, energy conserving, and support popular anisotropic parametric normal distribution functions such as Beckmann and GGX. While we do not provide closed-form expressions for the BSDFs, they are mathematically well-defined and can be evaluated at arbitrary precision. We show how to practically use them with Monte Carlo physically based rendering algorithms by providing analytic importance sampling and unbiased stochastic evaluation. Our implementation is analytic and does not use per-BSDF precomputed data, which makes our BSDFs usable with textured albedos, roughness, and anisotropy.},

	abstract = {Lambert's model for body reflection is widely used in computer graphics. It is used extensively by rendering techniques such as radiosity and ray tracing. For several real-world objects, however, Lambert's model can prove to be a very inaccurate approximation to the body reflectance. While the brightness of a Lambertian surface is independent of viewing direction, that of a rough surface increases as the viewing direction approaches the light source direction. In this paper, a comprehensive model is developed that predicts body reflectance from rough surfaces. The surface is modeled as a collection of Lambertian facets. It is shown that such a surface is inherently non-Lambertian due to the foreshortening of the surface facets. Further, the model accounts for complex geometric and radiometric phenomena such as masking, shadowing, and interreflections between facets. Several experiments have been conducted on samples of rough diffuse surfaces, such as, plaster, sand, clay, and cloth. All these surface demonstrate significant deviation from Lambertian behavior. The reflectance measurements obtained are in strong agreement with the reflectance predicted by the model.},

In this paper we review microfacet theory and demonstrate how it can be extended to simulate transmission through rough surfaces such as etched glass. We compare the resulting transmission model to measured data from several real surfaces and discuss appropriate choices for the microfacet distribution and shadowing-masking functions. Since rendering transmission through media requires tracking light that crosses at least two interfaces, good importance sampling is a practical necessity. Therefore, we also describe efficient schemes for sampling the microfacet models and the corresponding probability density functions.},

	abstract = {A new ray model is presented for the reflection of electromagnetic radiation from the rough air-material interface of a randomly rough surface. Unlike previous derivations that modeled the rough interface as consisting of microareas randomly oriented but flat (facets), this derivation models it as consisting of microareas not only randomly oriented but also randomly curved. Physically, the models are the same, but this new derivation leads to some new results. (1) For any given rough surface, there exists a single, optically smooth, curved surface of revolution of very restricted shape that will reflect radiation in the same distribution as that reflected by the rough interface. (2) Modeling that surface as an ellipsoid of revolution gives a surface-structure function that appears more accurate and useful than existing ones. (3) Unlike the facet derivations, this derivation lends itself to a normalization that gives the absolute, instead of just a comparative, reflectance-distribution function.},

	abstract = {The directional distribution of radiant flux reflected from roughened surfaces is analyzed on the basis of geometrical optics. The analytical model assumes that the surface consists of small, randomly disposed, mirror-like facets. Specular reflection from these facets plus a diffuse component due to multiple reflections and/or internal scattering are postulated as the basic mechanisms of the reflection process. The effects of shadowing and masking of facets by adjacent facets are included in the analysis. The angular distributions of reflected flux predicted by the analysis are in very good agreement with experiment for both metallic and nonmetallic surfaces. Moreover, the analysis successfully predicts the off-specular maxima in the reflection distribution which are observed experimentally and which emerge as the incidence angle increases. The model thus affords a rational explanation for the off-specular peak phenomenon in terms of mutual masking and shadowing of mirror-like, specularly reflecting surface facets.},

	abstract = {Realistic image generation is presented in a theoretical formulation that builds from previous work on the rendering equation. Previous and new solution techniques for the global illumination are discussed in the context of this formulation. The physical rules governing reflection are used to make improvements in local reflection models. The conventional local illumination models used in computer graphics are examined and modified to be consistent with these physical rules.Global illumination is treated in terms of evaluation of a Global Radiance Function. Image-based solution methods are phrased as a lazy evaluation of the Global Radiance Function; evaluation takes place for visible points. Zonal solution methods are phrased as table based solutions. A proof is given that, subject to certain constraints, only O(N) rays are required for a zonal solution with N zones. Simulation allows for surfaces which are not zoned to interact with those that are.The ray tracing zonal solution methods used for surfaces are extended to scenes with participating media. The impact of wavelength selection and time dependencies is also discussed.An object oriented implementation is discussed. This implementation separates the local and global illumination modules, so all of the specifics of the local models are hidden from the global energy transport code. This allows new local modules to be added by specifying the black box access routines.},

Instead of relying on a fully dynamic solution, we use a traditional static light baking pipeline and extend it with a small set of features that allow us to dynamically update the precomputed lighting at run-time with minimal performance and memory overhead. This means that our system works on the complete set of target hardware, ranging from high-end PCs to previous generation gaming consoles, allowing the use of lighting changes for gameplay purposes. In particular, we show how to efficiently precompute lighting changes due to individual lights being enabled and disabled and doors opening and closing. Finally, we provide a detailed performance evaluation of our system using a set of production levels and discuss how to extend its dynamic capabilities in the future.},

Using an analytic expression for the irradiance in terms of spherical harmonic coefficients of the lighting, we show that one needs to compute and use only 9 coefficients, corresponding to the lowest-frequency modes of the illumination, in order to achieve average errors of only 1%. In other words, the irradiance is insensitive to high frequencies in the lighting, and is well approximated using only 9 parameters. In fact, we show that the irradiance can be procedurally represented simply as a quadratic polynomial in the cartesian components of the surface normal, and give explicit formulae. These observations lead to a simple and efficient procedural rendering algorithm amenable to hardware implementation, a prefiltering method up to three orders of magnitude faster than previous techniques, and new representations for lighting design and image-based rendering.},

	abstract = {Computer generated shaded images have reached an impressive degree of realism with the current state of the art. They are not so realistic, however, that they would fool many people into believing they are real. One problem is that the surfaces tend to look artificial due to their extreme smoothness. What is needed is a means of simulating the surface irregularities that are on real surfaces. In 1973 Ed Catmull introduced the idea of using the parameter values of parametrically defined surfaces to index into a texture definition function which scales the intensity of the reflected light. By tying the texture pattern to the parameter values, the texture is guaranteed to rotate and move with the object. This is good for showing patterns painted on the surface, but attempts to simulate rough surfaces in this way are unconvincing. This paper presents a method of using a texturing function to perform a small perturbation on the direction of the surface normal before using it in the intensity calculations. This process yields images with realistic looking surface wrinkles without the need to model each wrinkle as a separate surface element. Several samples of images made with this technique are included.},
