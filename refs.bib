The shading algorithm itself depends in part on the method for modeling the object, which also determines the hidden surface algorithm. The various methods of object modeling, shading, and hidden surface removal are thus strongly interconnected. Several shading techniques corresponding to different methods of object modeling and the related hidden surface algorithms are presented here. Human visual perception and the fundamental laws of optics are considered in the development of a shading rule that provides better quality and increased realism in generated images.},

This is typically done by modelling the surface as a perfect diffuser, sometimes with a specular component added for the simulation of hilights. This paper presents a more accurate function for the generation of hilights which is based on some experimental measurements of how light reflects from real surfaces. It differs from previous models in that the intensity of the hilight changes with the direction of the light source. Also the position and shape of the hilights is somewhat different from that generated by simpler models. Finally, the hilight function generates different results when simulating metallic vs. nonmetallic surfaces. Many of the effects so generated are somewhat subtle and are apparent only during movie sequences. Some representative still frames from such movies are included.},

Parameters of the modelare the surface roughness given by the rms slope, the albedo, and thebalance between diffuse and specular reflection. The effect ofroughness on diffuse reflection is taken into account, instead of ourmodeling this component as a constant Lambertian term. The modelincludes geometrical effects such as masking and shadowing. Themodel is compared with experimental data obtained from goniophotometricmeasurements on samples of tiles and bricks. The model fits well tosamples with very different reflection properties. Measurements ofthe sample profiles performed with a laser profilometer to determinethe rms slope show that the assumed surface model is realistic. Themodel could therefore be used in machine vision and computer graphicsto approximate reflection characteristics of surfaces. It couldalso be used to predict the texture of surfaces as a function ofillumination and viewing angles.},

The model enables efficient simulation of effects that BRDF models cannot capture, such as color bleeding within materials and diffusion of light across shadow boundaries. The technique is efficient even for anisotropic, highly scattering media that are expensive to simulate using existing methods. The model combines an exact solution for single scattering with a dipole point source diffusion approximation for multiple scattering. We also have designed a new, rapid image-based measurement technique for determining the optical properties of translucent materials. We validate the model by comparing predicted and measured values and show how the technique can be used to recover the optical properties of a variety of materials, including milk, marble, and skin. Finally, we describe sampling techniques that allow the model to be used within a conventional ray tracer.},

The model has been especially intended for computer graphics applications and therefore includes two main features: simplicity (a small number of intuitively understandable parameters controls the model) and efficiency (the formulation provides adequation to Monte-Carlo rendering techniques and/or hardware implementations).},

	abstract = {Modeling multiple scattering in microfacet theory is considered an important open problem because a non-negligible portion of the energy leaving rough surfaces is due to paths that bounce multiple times. In this paper we derive the missing multiple-scattering components of the popular family of BSDFs based on the Smith microsurface model. Our derivations are based solely on the original assumptions of the Smith model. We validate our BSDFs using raytracing simulations of explicit random Beckmann surfaces.Our main insight is that the microfacet theory for surfaces with the Smith model can be derived as a special case of the microflake theory for volumes, with additional constraints to enforce the presence of a sharp interface, i.e. to transform the volume into a surface. We derive new free-path distributions and phase functions such that plane-parallel scattering from a microvolume with these distributions exactly produces the BSDF based on the Smith microsurface model, but with the addition of higher-order scattering.With this new formulation, we derive multiple-scattering micro-facet BSDFs made of either diffuse, conductive, or dielectric material. Our resulting BSDFs are reciprocal, energy conserving, and support popular anisotropic parametric normal distribution functions such as Beckmann and GGX. While we do not provide closed-form expressions for the BSDFs, they are mathematically well-defined and can be evaluated at arbitrary precision. We show how to practically use them with Monte Carlo physically based rendering algorithms by providing analytic importance sampling and unbiased stochastic evaluation. Our implementation is analytic and does not use per-BSDF precomputed data, which makes our BSDFs usable with textured albedos, roughness, and anisotropy.},

	abstract = {Lambert's model for body reflection is widely used in computer graphics. It is used extensively by rendering techniques such as radiosity and ray tracing. For several real-world objects, however, Lambert's model can prove to be a very inaccurate approximation to the body reflectance. While the brightness of a Lambertian surface is independent of viewing direction, that of a rough surface increases as the viewing direction approaches the light source direction. In this paper, a comprehensive model is developed that predicts body reflectance from rough surfaces. The surface is modeled as a collection of Lambertian facets. It is shown that such a surface is inherently non-Lambertian due to the foreshortening of the surface facets. Further, the model accounts for complex geometric and radiometric phenomena such as masking, shadowing, and interreflections between facets. Several experiments have been conducted on samples of rough diffuse surfaces, such as, plaster, sand, clay, and cloth. All these surface demonstrate significant deviation from Lambertian behavior. The reflectance measurements obtained are in strong agreement with the reflectance predicted by the model.},
